Requirements
Python Scripts

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc
    All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
    A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
